Becoming a patron really does help a whole lot <3.

## Features
- An interface and setup that's easy enough to use that even people that have any streaming experience can set it up in minutes.
- All chatters can have different voices
- You can set up a keybind in settings to abort any in progress TTS messages. Useful if someone decides to post the bee movie script...
- It only requires a channel name as a setting, it doesn't require any tokens or shenanigans.
- The window is transparent, and hides all buttons when the window is not on top. Just click in the window again to show all the buttons.
- Pokemon up to and including gen 7.

## Setup
### The program itself
Run chatmon.exe, and follow onscreen instruction.
Then click one of the pokeballs, stick in your twitch username and select a pokemon.
Type whatever prefix, like !poke you picked in settings followed by a message in your channel chat. You don't need to have an active stream for this.
Tada! You should hear a voice and see some text in a bubble under the pokemon.

### Streamlabs
It's really easy. Just pick the window in window capture, and set capture mode to windows 10.
That's all! You should now see the program with all it's glorious transparent background.
